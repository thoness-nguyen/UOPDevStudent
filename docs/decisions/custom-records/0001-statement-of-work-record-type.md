# Statement of Work Record Type

## Decision Drivers

* The list of agreements currently displayed to users in AMP is hard-coded in the AMP API project.
* The organization has a need to present different SOWs to customers based on their assigned Revenue Cohort Segment.

## Considered Options

* Add Logic to AMP
* Manage SOWs in NetSuite

## Decision Outcome

Chosen Options: Manage SOWs in NetSuite

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Add Logic to AMP

* Good, because it is faster to implement.
* Bad, because it requires MIS intervention to update in the future.

### Manage SOWs in NetSuite

* Good, because it allows end users to manage SOWs without MIS intervention.
* Good, because other "customer center" solutions (such as My TrueCommerce) can use the same information.
* Bad, because it take longer to implement.
