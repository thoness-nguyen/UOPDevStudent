# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml


trigger:
  - main   # Run this pipeline whenever code is pushed to 'main' branch

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'  # Use an Ubuntu virtual machine

steps:
  - task: UsePythonVersion@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: '3.x'      # Use latest Python 3.x

  - script: |
      pip install -r requirements.txt
    displayName: 'Install required Python packages'

  - script: |
      python your_script.py
    displayName: 'Run your Python script'

  # If you have tests with pytest, use this instead:
  # - script: |
  #     pytest
  #   displayName: 'Run tests'
